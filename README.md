# aws-cloudformation-template-schema
The CloudFormation template schema is intended to improve the authoring experience for our customers. It is a simple code process which converts our existing Resource Specifications files into a JSONSchema formatted document. This schema can be integrated into many publicly available IDEs such as Visual Studio Code &amp; PyCharm to provide inline syntax checking and code completion.
